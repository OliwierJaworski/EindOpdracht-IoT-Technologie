# Iot Project
## What is the aim

The aim of the IoT project is to clearly demonstrate the different aspects of developing and maintaining an IoT product. 

## Task
This includes automatically building the software for the appropriate platform, implementing automatic update mechanisms on the target platform and packaging the software in a specific format.

It is also very important that the software is able to send data to the provided database and restore itself if automatic updates fail. 

The project also includes displaying data in a dashboard and setting up a secure internet connection for the target platform.

## Teamwork

These goals are indicators of the student body's ability to handle hardware and software technologies and how effectively the team works.
